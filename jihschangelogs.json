(get it?)\n\n<size=24>what the games about:</size>\n\n* you can finally <b>jump in a hole</b>. that’s… basically it.\n\n<size=20>features:</size>\n<i> a <b>leaderboard</b> so you can see how many times you’ve jumped (and maybe flex to the w</i>hole* wide world).\n* meet the <b>sentient sign</b>: name? undetermined. the more you jump, the more it talks!\n* unlock <b>10 hole skins</b> as you jump more!\n* play with up to <b>8 friends</b> at the same time. more friends, more chaos, more.. i don't know. i'm running out of ideas.\n\n<size=18>notes</size>\n* the game is intentionally <b>boring and repetitive</b>. that’s kind of the point. embrace it! if you think this is misleading, you're wrong. the only gameplay is jumping in a hole.\n* first release, so expect <b>bugs, quirks, and maybe a grumpy sign</b>.\n\n[play now here!](https://www.roblox.com/games/125424155918172/JIHS-RELEASE)\n||<@&1391231650842808381>||"
