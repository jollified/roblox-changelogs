(get it?)\n\n<size=24>what the games about:</size>\n\n* you can <b>jump in a hole</b>! that’s… basically it.\n\n<size=24>features:</size>\n* a <b>leaderboard</b> so you can see how many times you’ve jumped (and maybe flex to the w<b>hole</b> wide world).\n* meet the <b>sentient sign</b>: name? undetermined. the more you jump, the more it talks!\n* unlock <b>10 hole skins</b> as you jump more!\n* play with up to <b>8 friends</b> at the same time. more friends, more chaos, more.. i don't know, i'm running out of ideas.\n\n<size=24>notes</size>\n* the game is intentionally <b>boring and repetitive</b>. that’s kind of the point. embrace it! if you think this is hyperbole, you're wrong. the only thing you do in this game is <b>jump in a hole</b>.\n* first release, so expect <b>bugs, quirks, and maybe a grumpy sign</b>.\n\n<b>https://www.roblox.com/games/125424155918172/JIHS-RELEASE</b>"
